I am a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor,
and I teach [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/),
[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), and
[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) workshops.
I further help to develop lessons for [Carpentries en Latinoam√©rica](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/paralatinoamerica.html).

As a Teaching Assistant, I led the development of the [quantitative training guide](https://ahurford.github.io/quantitative-training-guide) for the Department of Biology at Memorial University, which aims to introduce students to coding. I also have TAed several courses, including population and evolutionary ecology, evolution and systematics, and ecology. 

I am part of [R-Bar](https://daniellequinn.github.io/RBarMUN/),

Before starting my Ph.D., I was a full-time lecturer in the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Universidad de Carabobo for a year.
