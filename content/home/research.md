My current research is aimed at developing methods for data quality assessments in epidemiological studies. Broadly, this includes improving quality management routines, extending data quality tools and advancing metadata standards. 

In my Ph.D., I investigated the implications of trophic symbiosis by focusing on two marine bivalve species from Newfoundland, Canada, as a case study. These bivalves are a convenient natural experiment because they are [closely related](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/maec.12310), share the same habitat, have comparable life histories and show similar [foraging strategies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385110118301904). However, one species hosts [chemosynthetic bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914799) that are digested as a supplementary resource. As frameworks, I used a mix of dynamic energy budget theory and physiologically structured population models.

Previously, I investigated symbiosis via field observations in the Caribbean region. My research contributed to extending baseline knowledge of symbiotic interactions in marine invertebrates.
