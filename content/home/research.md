To investigate the implications of trophic symbiosis, during my Ph.D. I focused on two thyasirid bivalve species from Newfoundland, Canada, as a case study. These bivalves are [closely related](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/maec.12310), sympatric, show similar life history features, and are [particulate feeders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385110118301904). However, one species hosts [chemosynthetic bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914799) that are digested as a supplementary resource. As frameworks, I use a mixture of dynamic energy budget theory, physiologically structured population models, and optimal control theory.

Any attempt at understanding symbiosis must start by recognizing the relationship. For this reason, I have also dedicated a fraction of my research to building a baseline knowledge of other symbiotic interactions in marine invertebrates, especially in the Caribbean region.
