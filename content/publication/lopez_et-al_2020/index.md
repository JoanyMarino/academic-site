abstract = "*Alpheus platycheirus* Boone, 1927 (Decapoda, Alpheidae) is a snapping shrimp widely distributed in the western Atlantic, from the Gulf of Mexico to eastern Brazil. This shrimp usually inhabits muddy marine bottoms; however, here we record for the first time *A. platycheirus* in association with *Thalassia testudinum* and *Halodule wrightii* meadows at an unusually shallow depth in northwest Venezuela. This record extends the known habitat and distribution of *A. platycheirus* in the Caribbean. Moreover, it represents an additional alpheid species for Venezuela, bringing the known total to 34 species.."
